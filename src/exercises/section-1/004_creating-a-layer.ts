/**
 * You have implemented service constructors for the three services in the
 * Pun-ishment Protocol application and are now ready to create `Layer`s for
 * them.
 *
 * **Todo List**:
 *   - Define `Layer`s for each of the services in our Pun-ishment Protocol app
 *     - `PunDistributionNetworkLayer`
 *     - `PunsterClientLayer`
 *     - `ImmunityTokenManagerLayer`
 *   - Use the provided service constructors to implement your `Layer`s
 *
 * **Hint**: You'll probably want to import the `Layer` module from `"effect"`!
 *
 * **Bonus Objectives**
 *
 *   **Dependency Management**
 *     - Eliminate dependencies for each layer locally
 *       - I.e. The third type parameter of `Layer` should not contain any of
 *         our Pun-ishment Protocol services (it might contain others)
 *     - Stretch Goal: Compose all layers into one `MainLayer`
 *     - Super-Stretch Goal: Eliminate the `HttpClient` dependency from the
 *       `MainLayer` using the `NodeHttpClient` module from `@effect/platform-node`
 *
 *   **Error Handling**
 *     - Provide some mechanism of error handling for `Layer` errors
